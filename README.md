# MetaCrafters

In the Eth-Avax module 1. I write a smart contract based on the real world problem.

## Description
In this contract i take a situation, where a parent get their salary and he has to pay the expenses and other mandatory things. In this smart code code, i showcase the use of require, assert and revert. Revert Statement in function where i set the salary and budgetItem. It works as if parent salary is less than the expenses then the statement is revert.Require statement in fuction ChildAllowance. Where it first checks the condition that the allowance should be less than 100. And then assert in function to check the Remaining salary.
